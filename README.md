# calc.bot

Itâ€™s a simple split-pane calculator that lets users enter expressions in human terms on the left-hand side and see live results on the right. 
For example, you can assign variables (`Rent is $2,000` , `Months = 12`) and perform calculations using them (`AnnualRent = Rent * Months`). If you feel updating one variable, the rest of the expressions update in real time.
